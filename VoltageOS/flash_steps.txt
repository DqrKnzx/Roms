* You need to use a PC or OTG to transfer the Gapps.
Or restart the system, and download it from the browser that has the same ROM built in :)

* If the device or recovery allows it, you can flash the Gapps after flashing the ROM. 
At the moment, it didn't allow me to do so, and I had to do it after format data.
